sentence = [ "Hello", "you", "are", "NOT", "welcome", "here" ]

sentence.delete_at(-3)
sentence.join(" ")

# output : "Hello, you are welcome here"

# Why I can't chain the methods together to make
# sentence.delete_at(-3).join(" ") ?

# Because the return value from delete_at(-3) method is a string,
# which doesn't respond to the join method. It doesn't have that
# method.
